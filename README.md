# FARSI_Serial_3D_Monopile


FARSI is fortran code developed to study Fluid And Renewable Structure Interaction (FARSI) problems. 
The code originally developed to study wave forces on floating wind turbines. 
It has been used later to study other offshore structures, such as wave energy convertor, monopile and barge.
The model uses finite volume approach and explicit method to solve Navier-Stokes equations, level set method for tracking the wave's free surface and 
immersed boundary method to study solid-fluid interaction.
